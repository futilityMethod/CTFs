# CTFs
A collection of my notes and scripts from CTF challenges.

My [WeChall profile](https://www.wechall.net//profile/futilitymethod)

## OverTheWire.org
### [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)
* This is a nice warm up CTF. Should be quite easy if you're familiar with Linux.

### [Leviathan](https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/)
* Another beginner level linux-based CTF. This one is short, only 7 levels.

### [Natas](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/)
* This one focuses on web security. It starts off very simple, and increases in difficulty throughout 34 levels. You'll learn lots of ways to abuse php, a few things about sketchy perl, with a side of sql injection. 
* [Writeup](/OverTheWire/Natas/)

### [Krypton](https://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/)
* Krypton is all about code breaking. I really enjoyed these challenges, and found that writing some python scripts really helped with the second half.
* [Writeup](/OverTheWire/Krypton/)

### [Narnia](https://overthewire.org/wargames/narnia/)
* Another vulnerable linux host challenge
* [Write-up IN PROGRESS](/OverTheWire/Narnia)

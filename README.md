A collection of my notes and scripts from CTF challenges.

## OverTheWire.org
### [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)
	This is a nice warm up CTF. Should be quite easy if you're familiar with Linux.

### [Leviathan](https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/)
	Another beginner level linux-based CTF. This one is short, only 7 levels.

### [Natas](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/)
	This one focuses on web security. It starts off very simple, and increases in difficulty throughout 34 levels. You'll learn lots of ways to abuse php, a few things about sketchy perl, with a side of sql injection.

### [Krypton](https://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/)
	Krypton is all about code breaking. Currently in progress.
